'''
this function takes the unformatted string of all streetnames at an intersection
ex: "DELTA ST' & 'DELTA ST' & 'DEDI AVE' & 'DEDI AVE"
uses re.split to create a list of single street name, removes extra ' or other garbage
an empty list is created to store unique streets, and to be compared to the first list
and empty string is also created to make sure the output is normal
if an street is not in the outlist already, it is aappended
with the new outlist, a string is created by joining a separator string " to " to each item in the list
the function returns a string of unique streets separated with " to "
the separator can be changed, function can be altered to accept it as another input

function accepts a string, and a delimiter in quotes ie: " & "
        newstring = uniqueString(row[0], " & ")
